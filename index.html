  <p>From doing this assignment I realize I want to get better at debugging issues, since it seems I come across it constantly.
  Also to better undestand how to layout things on a website to make it more user friendly. Hopefully by the end of semester I can use this as part of my portfolio.
Hopefully with this class I can back into web production since I took web production 1 back when covid first hit.</p>
