      <h1>Static Site</h1>
        <p>This is my Static site <a href="https://macymeca12.github.io/index.html">opte</a></p>
          <p>It's static because it only pulls requests to server once and it not constantly uploading itself. It has a set way, if that makes sense</p>

      <h1>Dynamic Site</h1>
        <p>This is my Dynamic Site <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">opte</a></p>
        <p>It's a dynamic website because it's pulling requests, it allows you to login and create an accounts which requires a databases to pull and save this info </p>
